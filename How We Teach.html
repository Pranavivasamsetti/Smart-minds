        <h2>Tutoring Sessions</h2>
        <h3>
            Live, face-to-face and online so you can learn from the comfort of your own home without adding another thing to the family schedule.
            All sessions including demonstration, guided exercises and a review of previous practice work.
            We match every student with one of our expert tutors based on their learning needs and individual requirements.
            Sessions are designed to be fun and engaging, with access to interactive tools like collaborative whiteboards, video and audio capabilities.
            We teach the syllabus and then do it with the child then practice some of the topic.The method we use is the modeled , guided and practice.After
            practicing we give the children practice equations and review the lesson and topic.
        </h3>
        <h2>In person</h2>
        <h3>
            So in person we normally teach our content in a classroom with children with special needs.Like the online teaching , we teach the syllabus
            and then guide and then practice.After that they get given homework and review the lesson.
        </h3>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <h3>
            Some days, you’re on fire. You tick off your assignments one by one, and you’re proud of the quality of work you’ve produced. Everything seems to flow. 
            You’re in that elusive zone. Other days, though, something seems off. The words won’t come. You can’t seem to focus. Everything is a struggle.  
            Motivation is a very complicated subject with many dimensions. A simple way of looking at it is in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors
            are about personal satisfaction or achieving a goal. Extrinsic factors are tied to rewards and punishments. A very basic example would be keeping your room tidy.
            You might be motivated by the accomplishment of living in a clean and well-organised space (intrinsic). Or you may be motivated by the pocket money you receive at
            the end of the week, or by knowing that you won’t be able to see your friends on the weekend if your room is a mess. At first glance, you might think that intrinsic
            motivation is better, or even more noble, because it doesn’t relate to a system of reward/punishment. However, much of the world operates on a system of extrinsic motivation.
            How many people would go to work if they weren’t paid? In fact, most people need both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators in their lives.
